### Getting Started
```
  npm install
  npm run dev
  npm run build
  npm run serve
```

### Plan
- Create common scene and components
- WebGL, OpenGL. WenGPU
- create and smart contract
- connect meta mask
- import file from 3D software (limit 1000 files and more)
- (blender/python/gltf/obj/poly/c4d/babylon/unity/pixi.js/p2.js/ammo.js/p5.js)

- microservice. we can import multiple instance and reuse the components and create a meta for it
### INCOMMING
- web3
- smart contract solidity
- connect meta mask and walletconnect
- connect with another environment (It can be the metaverse common) (this isn't the real for now ^^)

### IMPORTANT
- just for research. the performance will impact the structure and build
- Mathematics and Physics
